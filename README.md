Development
Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

Node.js: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project. Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools. You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

npm install
We use npm scripts and Webpack as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

./mvnw
npm start
Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by specifying a newer version in package.json. You can also run npm update and npm install to manage dependencies. Add the help flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, npm help update.

The npm run command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.
